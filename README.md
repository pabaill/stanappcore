## About The Project

This is the core of the STAN project, which uses bootstrapping, webscraping, and other aspects of probability theory to create a dynamic alternative to predictive algorithms for sports. 

* The bbrefscraper.py file contains utility functions that scrape the latest game data from Basketball Reference.
* The game_core.py file allows a user to simulate a season, individual games, get odds for given games, and query season results at the end.
